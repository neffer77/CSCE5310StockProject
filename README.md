# CSCE5310_Project_Free_Cash_Flow_Group_20
Group 20 Project for CSCE5310 - Empirical Analysis (Connor Neff, Kevin Raj, Steven Houcks)


In this project we will be evaluating the historical data of 50 publicly traded companies across the U.S Stock exchange, forecasting the free cash flow (FCF). 

Free cash flow is defined as the difference between a company's operating expenses (e.g., salaries and taxes, but not interest expense, which is a financing and not an operating expense) and capital expenditures (e.g., money spent by a business acquiring or maintaining fixed assets). 

These two metrics are found within a company's quarterly reports or 10Q. Typically, FCF is of interest to both bond and stock investors and their valuation of the company because of the potential changes in working capital. FCF can provide important insights into the value of a company and the health of its fundamental trends. In general, the higher the free cash flow is, the healthier a company is, and in a better position to pay dividends, pay down debt, and contribute to growth. The goal of this project is to find out if a percentage increase in the  free cash flow YOY from a quarter has any significant effect on the stock price the following quarter. 

To achieve this, we will identify a sample set of 50 companies and gather its percentage increase in the  free cash flow YOY for each quarter for the past 5 years.  It is expected that a percentage increase in cash flow YOY from the previous quarter should have a statistically significant increase in stock price following 90 days from the report.
